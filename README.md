# Mission_to_Mars
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a web-based application, Mission to Mars, which would scrape data from Nasa websites in order to produce the most updated images, facts, and news about Mars upon accessing the website. 

## Process
- BeautifulSoup and Splinter were utilized in tandem with Python for the data scraping
- MongoDB as an open source NoSQL database management program, was used to store our data
- Flask created and displayed the data from the web scraping
- Python, HTML, and JavaScript alongwith Bootstrap 3 components were foundational in the creation of our web-based application
- Bootstrap 3 allowed for the application to become responsive to dimensions such as mobile-responsiveness, styling the *Scrape New Data* button, and customizing features such as the facts table
- PyMongo as the Python driver, allowed for us to interact with MongoDB databases

## Results
The images below are of the Mission to Mars web-based application, where the *Scrape New Data* button provides an updated web scrape from the Nasa Mars Science Exploration Program, with hemisphere images, facts, and articles.
